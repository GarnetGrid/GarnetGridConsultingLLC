# KB Sources (Raw)

Drop *raw* reference material here (exported docs, notes, SOPs, vendor docs, etc.).

These files are NOT intended to be ingested directly (they can be noisy / long).

Instead, run `scripts/kb_distill.py` to generate compact, high-signal “pattern cards” into:
- kb/powerbi/packs/
- kb/d365fo/packs/

Then ingest the generated packs.
