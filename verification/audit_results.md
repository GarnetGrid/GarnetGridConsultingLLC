# Site Audit & Verification Results

## 1. Global Updates
- **Header**: Applied `arch-logo-v2` (Quantum Core 3D CSS Logo) to:
  - `index.html`
  - `team.html`
  - `expertise.html`
  - `outcomes.html`
  - `showcase.html`
  - `jGPT.html`
  - `contact.html`
- **Footer**: Unified design with `architect-ribbon` and `Quantum Core` branding across all pages.
- **Backgrounds**: Custom CSS-only backgrounds implemented for:
  - `expertise.html`: Multi-layered background with relevant imagery (circuit, data center, dashboard, team).
  - `outcomes.html`: "Matrix Complex" background with scrolling code and parallax.
  - `showcase.html`: "Matrix Blueprint" background with animated data streams.

## 2. Page Specific Enhancements
### Outcomes Page (`outcomes.html`)
- **Structure**: Replaced standard grid with "Terminal Interface" cards.
- **Visuals**: Implemented live scrolling code snippets for each case study (SQL, C#, JSON).
- **Background**: Added `matrix-complex-bg` with 4 layers (Grid, System Check, Data Stream, Glow Orbs).

### Showcase Page (`showcase.html`)
- **Structure**: Added new core offerings (Sections 05 & 06).
- **New Content**:
  - **05. Digital Marketing & SEO**: Added CSS-only "SEO Terminal" visualization with bar charts and status logs.
  - **06. Process Automations**: Added CSS-only "Automation Flow" visualization with node grid and packet animation.
- **Background**: Implemented `matrix-blueprint-bg` wrapping the technical sections with `0x45 0x12 0x99` data streams.

## 3. Navigation & Links
- Validated all internal links in the header and footer.
- Checked `jGPT.html` linking correctly.

## 4. Performance
- **CSS**: Consolidated new styles into `styles.css`. No external JS libraries added for effects (pure CSS animations).
- **Load Time**: Should be optimal due to CSS-only approach over heavy imagery.

## 5. Next Steps
- Final browser testing of animations.
- Review mobile responsiveness of the new `glass-card` layouts.
